These scripts have not been written for commercial use and are therefore not maintained. They've been written for my own personal use but maybe of interest to others. They have been written as notebooks as this allows me to easily investigate different parts of my training.
However I was frustrated at the lack of options for combining menstrual and training data so I thought I'd share.
You will need to be able to run jupyter notebooks to use them but other than downloading the data and inputting the heartrate zones they should run without much need for editing. If you want to get an idea of what the code and results look like you can view the html template without compiling the python notebooks.

More information on what each script does is included within the text of the notebooks.

Some features I would like to add:
* Detect injury through absent runs. Reduce running distance on the return and add other activities then phase back to run.
* Use API to download the data. For Garmin this maybe possible with a browser emulator but this isn't viable for the menstrual tracking data.
* Use ML to predict plan rather than percentage increases.
* Convert into a package for easier use by none-programmers.
